This app is a Note Taker that uses front-end and back-end development inorder to make notes, store them on a server, and access them when clicked. This project involved creating the routes and fuctions to be able to get the information from the notes from the server we are creating as well as posting the new notes we are creating.

## Getting Started

To start this application, simply click on the link to the notes page. Once redirected, you can fill out a new note by clicking on the title, entering your title, then doing the same for the note text. To add the note to the column of saved notes, you can press the plus button in the upper right hand corner. You can click on different notes on the left-hand column to bring them up and you can press the red garbage icon to delete notes.

### Prequisties

To run this application there is nothing else required if you are using it from the deployed link.
